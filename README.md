### Fraud Detection System

#### Machine Learning, Encoder LLM, and FastAPI

#### Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Credit Card and Transaction Fraud Detection System using a hybrid machine learning approach. It combines supervised learning, anomaly detection, and encoder-based language model embeddings to identify fraudulent transactions. The system is deployed using FastAPI and includes a web-based dashboard for real-time interaction.

The application supports both single transaction prediction and bulk CSV-based fraud analysis.
